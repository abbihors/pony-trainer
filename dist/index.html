    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Click "Find devices" to scan for nearby toys</li>
        <li>Click "Start" to begin listening, the app is now ready to use</li>
        <li>Click "Pause" if you want to pause the app</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        If you check "Save recordings", the browser will save all speech
        it detects and you can click "Download Recordings" to save your
        recordings to a Zip file.
    </p>

    <h2>Will this spy on my microphone?</h2>
    <p>
        No. This app only saves the last 1 second of audio, and it is
        never uploaded to a server. You have the choice of saving your
        recordings to your computer assist with development.

        If you are still unconvinced, you can turn off your internet
        after loading this page, and the app will continue to work.
    </p>

    <h2>Browser compatibility</h2>
    <p>
        Currently only Chrome and Chromium-based browsers like Edge are
        supported,
        <strong>HOWEVER</strong> Firefox and Safari support will be
        added later but you will have to run <a href=https://intiface.com/desktop/">Intiface Desktop</a> on your
        desktop, as neither of these browsers can interact with
        Bluetooth devices directly.
